One Dark Throne (Three Dark Crowns, 2) by Kendare Blake Book Review

Name: Amy
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: One Dark Throne
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2017
Review: 4.5

The end of Three Dark Crowns left each of our Queens in a precarious state. Katherine had just been thrown down into the cavern of the Breccia Domain by her would be love Pietyr; we discovered Arsinoe is not really the naturalist she‚Äôs been raised to be, instead she is a poisoner (!); and Mirabella‚Äôs impressive show at the Quickening Ceremony is swiftly overshadowed by what many view as her cowardice when she ran from Arsinoe‚Äôs bear familiar.

Moving on, however, the Queens must now continue the traditions of the Ascension Year, which includes courting suitors and taking steps to ensure their victory over the other Queens (i.e. plotting each other‚Äôs deaths). It quickly becomes apparent that this Ascension is not like those in the past. Mirabella, Arsinoe, and Katherine are not quick to abide by traditions, but their will to survive may cause the bloodiest battle yet.

I applaud Ms. Blake with taking these three completely different sisters, giving them the grotesque job of having to kill each other to reign victorious, giving each of them their faults (some more sinister than others), and still making me care about what happens to each one. After her return from Breccia Domain, a bloodthirsty Katherine would be easy to paint the villain, but you can see something mysterious happened when she was thrown into that cavern and despite any bravado she‚Äôs developed, she still has moments of vulnerability.

However, the sister who really stands out for me is Arsinoe. Even after living her life thinking her gift had betrayed her and being told she would be one of the sisters to die, Arsinoe never gave up living. She probably has the most true and devoted family/friend base of the triplets and it has helped her to remain strong and positive. Considering how things progress in One Dark Throne, she certainly needs it as we begin to see where true loyalties lie this time around.

What keeps this read from being a full five stars comes back to the fact that this was originally supposed to be a duology, and now is expanding into a four book series. While this is great news, you can clearly see, especially from the middle onward, how the plot kind of winds down from the fast-paced start is has at the beginning. I felt like things get a bit repetitive in places as it‚Äôs being ensured to leave enough open to continue to books three and four.

Regardless of this, Kendare Blake makes an extremely readable story with three very compelling female leads (not to mention all those secondary characters as well). She‚Äôs not afraid to take risks with her characters while readers are once again left desperately hoping their favorites survive to the end, and the others get their comeuppance.

Title: Blake's easy to follow prose
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2017
Review: One Dark Throne is about 50 shades darker than it's predecessor Three Dark Crowns. Blake's easy to follow prose, purposeful pacing, an onslaught of plot-twists, leads its readers down a gruesome and tumultuous conclusion that will lead its readers scrambling for more.

Blake masterfully utilizes the narrative style to create a sense of mystery and makes you want to turn the page eagerly. I personally struggled a bit with the pacing of book one, but this book maximizes on that flaw and fixes it. This book took off and hit the ground running. Blake allows us to learn more about each sister's history with one another and the history they have with their families. If the first book was about world-building, this book was dedicated to character building. Mirabella is powerful in skills but is probably the least ruthless of the three. She will do anything to protect her sister Arsinoe from Katherine, who the latter has decided to target first by thinking she's weak. Mirabella has a nice balance to her character because she seems meek but her power can be so destructive. It was a pleasure getting to know her friends Elizabeth and Bree, who added a fun dynamic to Mirabella's chapters.

While Mirabella's story seemed to be the most intriguing in book one to me, Katherine and Arsinoe captivated me ever so much in this installment. In book one Katherine struggled because she didn't initially have the power to withstand the poisons she was expected to ingest on a regular basis. That meek girl we knew who struggled to find her identity is gone. Replacing her is a ruthlessly cunning girl who is very much other-wordly. Katherine consumes poison every chance she gets and allows the betrayal and despair she's feeling to rule her reason. Katherine is transformed entirely in this installment, and it leaves readers wondering what truly happened when she fell into that pit. Blake teases us with hints throughout the book, but leaves much to be desired in order to captivate on the intrigue and mystery to Katherine's struggle. Blake doesn't let us forget to humanize Katherine despite her transformation, and we see this in her special moments with Pietyr. We see a girl who just wants to be loved and accepted, but often is forgotten about due to her new found bloodlust and yearning for vengeance.

Now I have always had a special place in my heart for Arsinoe and the naturalist's world. If you read the first book we know now that Arsinoe is a true poisoner. Arsinoe was a character who fought to find her place amongst the naturalist even though she had no aptitutude for it. Like Katherine, the naturalist camp and Arsinoe's closests friends protected that secret. It was amazing to see Arsinoe find her place in this book and see that she could be strong like her naturalist prodigal friend, Jules. I loved the romances that were built up in this installment, and Jules and Joseph were just as much a focal point as the three Queens. Jules in particular seemed to pay a prominent role and didn't seem so secondary. I predict her story being pushed even further in the next book.

One Dark Throne takes us down a path of darkness and turmoil, but often lightens the mood with budding romances. The magical world of Fennbirn has never felt more engrossing, and we see Blake flaunt her gift for mysterious flare expertly. Readers will be scrambling for the next book with Blake's delightful, yet infuriating talent to build her characters and plot with open-ended futures.
